ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Francisco (@FranciscoSerranoBaptista) and I am an executive coach. 

I coach engineers, team leads, and executives on the topic of Leadership.

But I am also a scientist and someone who grew up with software.

This collection of repositories documents the efforts to bring my best of coaching to you:

- Data for Sales coaching, intended to create an AI for sales coaching
- A survey processing tool to evaluate and give individual feedback (archived)
- (Flagship) An AI workflow engine to solve problems with an AI graph.
- (Flagship) A social listening tool
- (Flagship) A social enrichment tool. Originally intended to develop an avatar for my coaching business.
- and of course loop, which has been saving my life for years
