ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Francisco (@FranciscoSerranoBaptista) and I work in Enablement.

**Enablement**, just like **Leadership** and **Training**, have many definitions and nuances.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in human capacity development and learning in everything I do. I believe we can be better sales people, better customer success managers, and better technology leaders if we are able to put #relationshipfirst, create spaces for others to learn, and walk our talk.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently working on a portfolio of coaching and enablement with AI.
