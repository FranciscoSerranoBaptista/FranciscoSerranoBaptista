👋 Hi, I’m Francisco (@FranciscoSerranoBaptista) and I work in Enablement.

**Enablement**, just like **Leadership** and **Training**, have many definitions and nuances.

👀 I’m interested in human capacity development and learning in everything I do. I believe we can be better sales people, better customer success managers, and better technology leaders if we are able to put #relationshipfirst, create spaces for others to learn, and walk our talk.

🌱 I’m currently working on the Everyday Enablement Repository. Sharing a decade of my life's learnings in an open source format is inspired by Marshall Goldsmith's concept of Knowledge Philanthropy.
