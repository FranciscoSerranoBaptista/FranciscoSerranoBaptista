I build infrastructure for human development.

The question that occupies me: *Can we create systems that help people grow without reducing growth to a formula?*

I sit at an uncomfortable intersection—executive coach and AI engineer. Most days I'm not sure those two selves belong together. The coach in me knows that development is relational, emergent, resistant to optimization. The engineer wants to scale what works, to encode expertise into systems that reach beyond one-to-one conversations.

The tension is productive. I think.

## What I'm Building

**Ego Stage Assessment System** — An agentic architecture that estimates developmental stage from ethically sourced data. Not a classifier. A system of advocates and critics that debate, challenge assumptions, and flag their own biases. It knows it might be wrong. Tested and validated against a corpus of publicly available texts.

Built on Cook-Greuter's EDT and Dawson's Lectical frameworks. The system doesn't output certainty, rather it outputs calibrated confidence with transparent reasoning.

**Oak9** — Infrastructure for AI-augmented coaching. Privacy-first. Multi-tenant. The boring enterprise stuff that lets the interesting work happen safely.

## The Premise

Most AI in coaching falls into two traps:
1. Replacing the coach with a chatbot (losing the relational core)
2. Adding AI as a gimmick (losing the rigor)

I'm interested in a third path: AI as cognitive infrastructure that extends what a skilled coach can perceive, remember, and synthesize—without pretending to replace the human judgment that makes coaching work.

This might be wrong. Scaling intimacy might be a contradiction. But the alternative—keeping developmental support locked behind expensive one-to-one relationships—feels worse.

## Technical Approach

- Agentic systems with adversarial validation (multiple perspectives, built-in doubt)
- Structured outputs with explicit uncertainty quantification
- RAG architectures for domain-specific reasoning
- Privacy-by-design for sensitive developmental data

Python. TypeScript. Anthropic Claude. The stack matters less than the epistemology.

## Current Questions

- How do you assess development without flattening it into stages?
- What's lost when we systematize tacit expertise?
- Can AI hold context across months of coaching in ways humans can't?
- Where's the line between augmentation and replacement?

I don't have answers. I have working hypotheses and systems that might disprove them.
